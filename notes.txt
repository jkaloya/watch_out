so dist = acos(sin(lat1)*sin(lat2) + cos(lat1)*cos(lat2)*cos(long)) * radius of earth

this is the formula

step 1: we need to get all the data from the database and check which loc:{lat, long} is inside that distance/ radius

so we have initial loc{lat, long}, 2nd one we get from the database, we measure the distance between those 2 points and if it is < dist, then we list it


{crimes :
    {
        spotcrime : [{}]
        user : [{},{},...]
    }
}

this is one

{crimes:
[{<spotcrime's>}],[<user's>]
}

this is another


*If you add multiple alerts at the same location, the last one(most up to date) is the only one that will show up on the map. I can fix it later if time permits. It's called overlapping marker function.
